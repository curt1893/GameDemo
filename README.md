# GameDemo

## V0.1 Initial Demo

1. WASD to move your ship around.
2. Left Mouse click to shoot manual cannons.
3. On start up, using the Ship Builder to add components. Right now you can freely build your ship in any way. Use the Boxes at the top to switch between your ships.
4. If there's a save file issue, or you want to give yourself more money after your inital loading of the game, you can find it in your App Data/Local/Blockade Breaker/save.txt (on Windows).
